\title{Standardize Compound Names for KEGG Matching}
\usage{
standardize_name(names_vector)
}
\arguments{
\item{names_vector}{Character vector of compound names}
}
\value{
Character vector of standardized names
}
\description{
Cleans chemical names optimized for KEGG database matching.
}
\details{
**Specifically tuned for KEGG**, this function:
\itemize{
  \item Removes KEGG annotations in brackets (e.g., `"[Similar to...]"`)
  \item Eliminates stereochemical descriptors (e.g., `"(2S,3R)"`)
  \item Cleans numeric artifacts from Compound Discoverer exports
  \item Standardizes KEGG-specific base names (e.g., `"norchol"` â†’ `"norcholane"`)
  \item Normalizes hyphens and whitespace
}
}
\note{
**Not suitable for other chemical databases** (e.g., HMDB, PubChem) which use
different naming conventions.
}
\examples{
compound_names <- c(
  "Testosterone [Similar to Androgen]",
  "D-Glucose (2S,3R)",
  "-123-Cholestane-1-ene",
  "norchol derivative"
)

standardized <- standardize_name(compound_names)
print(standardized)  # "Testosterone" "D-Glucose" "Cholestane-ene" "norcholane derivative"

}
